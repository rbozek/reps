"Practice makes practice makes practice makes prefect oops makes perfect."

The human mind has an incredible capacity for learning different skills. You don't need talent. All it takes is desire, discipline, and REPETITION. Reps is designed to help you keep track and keep yourself accountable. 

Every time you practice (or "do a rep"), add it to your list! If you're working in multiple disciplines, add a custom category label. Customize each entry with as much (or as little) detail as you like. Add an optional image. See all your reps listed in one place & build up momentum as you keep doing more! I believe in you!
